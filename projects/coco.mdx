# COCO - Conversation Coach

## Overview

COCO is a real-time AI conversation coach that helps you improve your communication skills during live conversations, negotiations and meetings. Using ElevenLabs text-to-speech, COCO whispers intelligent coaching suggestions directly in your ear while you're speaking, then provides comprehensive feedback after your session ends.

Unlike traditional conversation training that requires reviewing recordings after the fact, COCO analyzes your speech as it happens and delivers actionable advice through natural-sounding voice feedback powered by ElevenLabs TTS.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Voice Coaching**: Live transcription with context-aware suggestions delivered as natural speech via ElevenLabs TTS
- **Post-Session Analysis**: "2 Stars and a Wish" feedback framework with filler word tracking, key takeaways, and conversation summary
- **Beautiful UI**: Smooth Rive animations and responsive design for an engaging user experience
- **Coaching when you need it most**: Fast audio pipeline ensures coaching feels natural and unobtrusive

## How It Works

1. **Set Context**: Enter your name, conversation setting (meeting, salary negotiation, interview, etc.), and goal for the conversation
2. **Start Recording**: COCO captures and transcribes your voice in real-time via WebSocket
3. **Receive Coaching**: Coco analyzes conversation patterns in real time and generates helpful suggestions
4. **Hear Feedback**: ElevenLabs TTS converts suggestions into natural-sounding voice prompts
5. **Review & Improve**: End your session for AI-generated feedback with strengths, areas for growth, and actionable takeaways
